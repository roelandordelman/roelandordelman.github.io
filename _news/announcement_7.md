The upcoming CLARIAH Tech Day will take place on Thursday 29 September. During the Tech Day, we will pay attention to the technical infrastructural issues that play a role in other projects related to CLARIAH.

CLARIAH is committed to the development of a national digital research infrastructure for the SSH domain. Such an infrastructure is comprehensive, which is why CLARIAH actively seeks collaboration with other projects in the Netherlands that are working on components of that national infrastructure from different perspectives.

The technical realization of a digital research infrastructure involves a large number of challenges. Sometimes these are driven by specific needs of researchers or data managers within the infrastructure, sometimes these challenges have a more general technical or practical background. Within CLARIAH and the projects mentioned above, the main challenges have now been identified, solutions are being considered and development has already started in various places. For instance around topics such as making tools and data more readily available, (secure) access to large datasets to analyze and visualize data yourself (for example with Jupyter Notebooks or applications such as DRUID), and making and keeping annotations around different types of datasets and different parts of the infrastructure.

We think it is useful and important to have regular discussions with other DH projects and developers in the Netherlands working on similar topics about the technical solutions, possibilities, preconditions and choices when developing a joint infrastructure, and to make use of the enormous potential of knowledge and expertise present in this broad field. With this in mind, CLARIAH organizes informal Tech Days every quarter.

The Tech Days are freely accessible to everyone, both on location and online. However, registration is required. Register here: https://www.clariah.nl/events/welcome-to-clariah-tech-day
