On the 30rd of June 2020, the CLARIAH project organised its quarterly Tech Day at the IISG to present and discuss progress on the development of the CLARIAH Infrastructure. We started with a short introduction on how we arrived at the [Shared Development Roadmap](/assets/pdf/20220630-SharedDevelopmentRoadmap2022-2023.pdf) that is clustered around 7 topics that will guide the development of the CLARIAH infrastructure for the coming years:

1. How do we aim for FAIR data in CLARIAH? Femmy Admiraal ([Part 1](/assets/pdf/220630_CLARIAH_TechDag_FAIR_data.pdf) and Menzo Windhouwer [Part 2])(/assets/pdf/SDRQ2-demo2022-FAIR_datasets_Vocabs_Data Stories.pdf). 

2. [Vocabularies, what are they for and how do we support them in CLARIAH](/assets/pdf/SDRQ2-demo2022-FAIR_datasets_Vocabs_Data Stories.pdf) by Menzo Windhouwer

3. [How can we help scholars finding tools they need](https://github.com/orgs/CLARIAH/projects/1) by Maarten van Gompel

4. How can we guide scholars towards the CLARIAH infrastructure and its resources: [Soft-launch of INEO, the CLARIAH Portal](/assets/pdf/2202-06-30_Presentatie_oplevering_Ineo.pdf) by Sebastiaan Fluitsma

5. [How we want to support multimedia, cross-platform annotations in CLARIAH](/assets/FAIR_Annotation_Rolodex-CLARIAH_techday_june_30.pdf) by Hennie Brugman

6. [How CLARIAH aims to facilitate creation of Data Stories & computational scholarship](/assets/pdf/SDRQ2-demo2022-FAIR_datasets_Vocabs_Data Stories.pdf) by Menzo Windhouwer

7. How can we build a robust & scalable infrastructure: [Distribution & Deployment, what does this mean](/assets/Distribution_deployment.pdf) by Thomas Vermaut

We closed the meeting with a formal handover of the CLARIAH project lead from Antal van den Bosch to Dirk van Miert who emphasized the need to connect and communicate with the potential users of the CLARIAH infrastructure, in addition to the development work discussed during the Tech Day.
