Some six years ago, we started with the design and development of the [CLARIAH Media Suite](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/) in the CLARIAH-Core project. As we are now in the final two years of its successor, the CLARIAH-PLUS project, it seemed an appropriate time to discuss if our original ideas on Media Suite, as a tool for researchers to work with (audiovisual) media, still hold. During our regular CLARIAH WP5 meeting Thursday June 16th --after two years of online meetings finally face-2-face again!-- we had a fruitful kick-off for this discussion, with a brief look at where we started, what improvements were added recently, and a first exploration of perspectives we should take into account in our thinking about the future of the Media Suite. This blog is a brief summary of our discussions.

## Past

The first design of Media Suite was first of all inspired by a number of CLARIAH predecessor projects such as [TROVE](https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/knowledge/projects/trove-transmedia-observatory), [AVResearcher](https://publications.beeldengeluid.nl/pub/27), and [Verteld Verleden](https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/knowledge/projects/verteld-verleden). In designing the Media Suite, we used cooking as a metaphor: the idea was that we should provide a kitchen (research environment) with recipes (workflows, tutorials), cutlery (tools) and ingredients (data), so that researchers would be able to prepare their own 'delicious dishes'. We translated this into four areas "Data", "Tools", "Workspace" and "Learn" that became the main building blocks of the Media Suite, that now incorporates:

<ul>
    <li>An impressive body of <b>data sets</b> of different media types from NISV (including Parliament Meetings), National Library, Eye Film, DANS, Meertens Institute, 'findable' via the [Media Suite Data Registry](https://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/), and accessible via [Media Suite search](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/single-search)</li>
    <li>A set of <b>tools</b>:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>[Collection Inspector](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/collection-inspector) for metadata inspection</li>
        <li>Advanced Collection Search with metadata selection options (e.g., searching speech recognition transcripts or persons via thesaurus labels), filters, and result visualisation options (Fig.1)</li>
        <li>Resource Viewer to watch, browse and annotate items from collections</li>
        <li>Compare Tool to investigate occurrences of terms across collections</li>
        <li>[Explore Tool](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/tool/exploratory-search) to browse datasets using linked data principles</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A [workspace](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/workspace/projects) (requires login) to store bookmarks, annotations and queries</li>
    <li>[Help](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/documentation) functions, How-tos, FAQs and a growing number of (video) [tutorials](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/learn) to help users working with the Media Suite</li>
</ul>

## Present

Recently, we added some new features to the Media Suite:

<ul>
    <li>Support for creating annotations on a timeline in the Resource Viewer</li>
    <li>Linking of person names in the Resource Viewer to information sources such as the Beeld & Geluid Thesaurus or WikiData, including the possibility to select all other collection items for this person in one click</li>
    <li>new visualization options in the search and compare tool (e.g., visualizing search results per broadcaster)</li> 
</ul>

A lot of the development work for Media Suite happened 'under the hood'. For instance, we had to update Elastic Search to a new version, improved the underlying data infrastructure to the Beeld & Geluid archive to incorporate also the most recent material, and of course 'squashed' a number of bugs. The largest 'invisible' project we have been working on is the data analysis infrastructure ([DANE](https://dane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) that allows us to run data analysis algorithms, such as speech recognition, computer vision and named-entity extraction, in a scalable manner on large data sets.
